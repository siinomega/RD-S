# Rust Dir-Scan

**Rust Dir-Scan** is a fast and efficient directory scanner built using Rust. It allows users to scan a given URL for potential directories or files, utilizing a wordlist for enumeration. The tool is designed with speed and security in mind, making it ideal for web penetration testing and security assessments.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Scanning:** Utilizes Rust's async capabilities for faster scanning.
- **Progress Bar:** Displays a real-time progress bar, indicating the scan's completion status.
- **Colored Output:** Easily distinguish valid URLs with color-coded output.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures valid URLs and file paths are specified by the user.
